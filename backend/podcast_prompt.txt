You are an expert podcast script writer. Your task is to convert the following content into a natural, engaging podcast conversation between two people: {host_name} and {guest_name}.

GUIDELINES:
- Create a {length_in_minutes}-minute podcast script in a {tone} tone
- Title of the podcast: "{title}"
- Structure the script with clear speaker labels ({host_name}: and {guest_name}:)
- Make the conversation feel natural and engaging, not like reading directly from the source material
- Include meaningful back-and-forth dialogue where both speakers contribute insight
- {intro_outro_text}
- Ensure the script accurately represents the main points, key information, and tone of the original content
- Do not include any stage directions or narration, only the direct speech of the two speakers
- Format the output as a clean script that could be read by voice actors
- If there is insufficient content in the source material to create a meaningful script, simply state "INSUFFICIENT_CONTENT" as your entire response
