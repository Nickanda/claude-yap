# Carbon-Aware Computing: Designing Sustainable Datacenters

Dr. Green: Hello Alex! I'm excited to talk with you today about an important topic in sustainable computing—specifically, how we can design datacenters to minimize their carbon footprint. We'll be discussing a framework called Carbon Explorer that helps analyze different approaches to achieving carbon-free datacenter operations.

Alex: Hi Dr. Green. I've been hearing a lot about tech companies claiming they're "carbon neutral" or "100% renewable," but I'm not sure what that actually means in practice. Are datacenters really green?

Dr. Green: That's a great question to start with. Technology companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon have made significant investments in renewable energy to offset their datacenter electricity consumption. Collectively, they've invested in around 22 gigawatts of renewable energy generation. However, there's an important distinction between what's called "Net Zero" and "24/7 carbon-free energy."

Alex: What's the difference between those two approaches?

Dr. Green: With Net Zero, companies invest in renewable energy generation and receive credits from power purchase agreements. On an annual basis, they generate enough renewable energy to match their total consumption. But on an hourly basis, datacenters often consume carbon-intensive energy from the grid when carbon-free energy is scarce.

Alex: Oh, I see. So they might use energy from coal or natural gas during certain hours, even though they're generating clean energy elsewhere or at different times?

Dr. Green: Exactly. Think of it like a financial budget. Net Zero is like saying, "By the end of the year, I'll have earned as much money as I spent," but 24/7 carbon-free is saying, "I'll make sure I have enough money for every purchase at the exact moment I need to make it." The 24/7 approach is much more challenging because renewable energy sources like wind and solar are intermittent—they fluctuate based on weather conditions and time of day.

Alex: That makes sense. So what makes this intermittent nature of renewables such a problem for datacenters specifically?

Dr. Green: Datacenters require constant, reliable power to operate. Figure 1 in the paper illustrates how wind and solar energy generation can vary dramatically throughout the day and week. Sometimes, renewable energy is abundant—even exceeding demand—and other times it's scarce. When there's not enough renewable energy, datacenters must draw from carbon-intensive sources like coal or natural gas.

Alex: Can't they just store the excess renewable energy for when they need it later?

Dr. Green: That's one approach, and we'll discuss it in detail shortly. The paper presents three main strategies for achieving 24/7 carbon-free computing: investing in renewable energy generation, deploying energy storage solutions like batteries, and implementing carbon-aware scheduling to shift computational workloads. Each has its own advantages and challenges.

Alex: This sounds complicated. Is there a systematic way to analyze all these different approaches?

Dr. Green: Yes, that's where the Carbon Explorer framework comes in. Carbon Explorer is a design space exploration tool that helps datacenter architects identify carbon-optimal solutions. It considers both operational carbon—emissions from the energy used to run the datacenter—and embodied carbon—emissions from manufacturing the infrastructure, like servers, batteries, and renewable energy equipment.

Alex: I hadn't thought about the carbon cost of manufacturing the equipment. That's interesting. So how does Carbon Explorer work?

Dr. Green: Carbon Explorer takes two main inputs: time-series data about datacenter power demand and renewable energy supply across different geographic locations. Then it explores solutions across three dimensions: investments in different types of renewable energy, investments in energy storage capacity, and opportunities for shifting computation based on carbon intensity.

The framework simulates these different strategies and calculates both the operational and embodied carbon for each solution. This helps identify what the authors call the "carbon-optimal" design.

Alex: Can you walk me through these three solutions in more detail? Let's start with renewable energy investments.

Dr. Green: Certainly. The first approach is investing in renewable energy like wind and solar farms. The paper shows that different geographic regions have different renewable energy profiles. Some regions, like Oregon, are primarily served by wind energy. Others, like North Carolina, rely mainly on solar. And some regions have a mix of both.

One key finding is that it takes significantly more renewable energy investments to reach 100% coverage than to reach, say, 95% coverage. In fact, it takes more than 5 times more renewable capacity to go from 95% to 99.9% than to go from 0% to 95%!

Alex: Wow, that's a steep curve. Why does that happen?

Dr. Green: It's because of the intermittent nature of renewables. To cover those remaining hours when renewable energy is scarce, you need massive overcapacity. This creates what the authors call a "long tail" problem. Think of it like this: it's relatively easy to have an umbrella with you on days when the forecast clearly predicts rain, but to have an umbrella with you on 100% of the days it might rain would require carrying one almost all the time—a much larger investment.

Alex: I see. So what about the second approach—energy storage?

Dr. Green: Energy storage, particularly lithium-ion batteries, can help bridge the gap during periods when renewable energy generation is low. The paper models batteries that can be charged when renewable energy is abundant and discharged when it's scarce.

The researchers found that the amount of battery capacity needed varies significantly by region. Regions with a mix of wind and solar energy require less battery capacity because these sources tend to complement each other—when solar is unavailable at night, wind might still be generating, and vice versa.

Alex: How much battery capacity are we talking about here?

Dr. Green: For some datacenters, we're talking about batteries that can power the datacenter for 2-5 hours, which is substantial. The paper mentions that the largest utility-scale energy storage project so far offers 300 MW of power and 1,200 MWh of capacity. For context, many hyperscale datacenters operate at 20-40 MW.

An interesting finding is that regions that rely heavily on wind power, like Oregon, face challenges with batteries because there can be multiple consecutive days with very little wind. Similarly, regions relying solely on solar power need larger batteries to cover nighttime hours.

Alex: That makes sense. What about the third approach—carbon-aware scheduling?

Dr. Green: Carbon-aware scheduling takes advantage of the fact that not all computational workloads are time-sensitive. The paper notes that approximately 40% of datacenter workloads can be delayed or rescheduled without significant impact. This includes tasks like AI model training, data processing pipelines, and offline video processing.

With carbon-aware scheduling, these flexible workloads are shifted from times when carbon-intensive energy is being used to times when carbon-free energy is abundant.

Alex: So it's like running your dishwasher or charging your electric car during off-peak hours?

Dr. Green: That's a great analogy! Just as you might run your dishwasher at night when electricity rates are lower, datacenters can schedule certain workloads when renewable energy is plentiful. However, this approach requires additional server capacity to handle these deferred workloads when they're eventually processed.

The paper found that carbon-aware scheduling requires between 6% to 76% additional server capacity, depending on the region. This extra capacity is needed because the datacenter must process both current and deferred workloads during periods of abundant renewable energy.

Alex: That brings up an interesting question. If you need to build more servers to enable scheduling, doesn't that create more emissions during manufacturing?

Dr. Green: Exactly right! This is where the trade-off between operational and embodied carbon becomes critical. Manufacturing servers, batteries, solar panels, and wind turbines all produce what's called "embodied carbon"—the emissions associated with creating and eventually recycling the equipment.

The paper presents embodied carbon values: wind turbines produce 10-15 grams of CO2 per kWh over their lifetime, solar panels 40-70 grams, lithium-ion batteries 74-134 kilograms per kWh of capacity, and each server approximately 744.5 kg of CO2.

Alex: So there's a balance to be struck here. How does Carbon Explorer determine what's optimal?

Dr. Green: Carbon Explorer finds the solution that minimizes the sum of operational and embodied carbon. Interestingly, the researchers discovered that achieving 100% 24/7 carbon-free operation isn't always the carbon-optimal solution because the embodied carbon cost might outweigh the operational carbon savings for those last few percentage points.

Alex: That's counterintuitive! I would have thought 100% carbon-free would always be the goal.

Dr. Green: It's a nuanced finding that highlights the importance of holistic analysis. For instance, in some regions, the carbon-optimal solution achieves only 37% to 97% 24/7 coverage when relying solely on renewable energy. When batteries are added, four regions can reach 100% coverage optimally, and the rest can reach around 99%.

The combination of all three approaches—renewables, batteries, and carbon-aware scheduling—makes 100% coverage the carbon-optimal solution in five regions and above 99% for most others.

Alex: How did geographic location affect the results?

Dr. Green: Location plays a crucial role. The paper examined 13 regions where Meta has datacenters and found that Iowa and Nebraska (which have primarily wind energy) and hybrid regions like Texas (with both wind and solar) are optimal for minimizing carbon costs.

This is because these regions have "shallower valleys"—fewer periods with extremely low renewable energy availability. In contrast, regions that rely primarily on solar energy struggle to achieve high coverage because solar is unavailable during nighttime hours.

Alex: This is fascinating. Are there any other interesting findings you could share?

Dr. Green: One interesting finding relates to battery management. The researchers found that the depth of discharge (DoD)—how deeply you drain the batteries—affects both battery lifespan and total carbon impact. 

Using an 80% DoD instead of 100% increases battery lifespan by 50%, but requires larger batteries with 43% more embodied carbon. In the end, the 80% DoD approach lowers total carbon by about 5% on average across the regions studied, showing another nuanced trade-off in the design space.

Alex: I'm curious about the practical implications. If you were designing a new datacenter today, what approach would you recommend based on this research?

Dr. Green: Based on this research, I'd recommend a multi-faceted approach:

First, site selection is critical—choosing locations with complementary renewable energy sources like both wind and solar reduces the severity of supply fluctuations.

Second, invest in a mix of renewable energy appropriate for your location, but don't aim for 100% coverage through renewables alone—the diminishing returns are too steep.

Third, deploy batteries sized for a few hours of operation to handle short-term fluctuations in renewable supply.

Fourth, implement carbon-aware scheduling for flexible workloads, which can reduce the required battery capacity.

And finally, analyze your specific situation using a holistic approach like Carbon Explorer that accounts for both operational and embodied carbon.

Alex: This makes me wonder about the future. As renewable energy technology improves and battery costs come down, will these trade-offs change?

Dr. Green: Absolutely. The authors acknowledge that the field is evolving rapidly. Battery technology is improving, with lithium-ion battery costs declining by 80% between 2015 and 2020. Renewable energy efficiency is also improving. And as more computing workloads become delay-tolerant, like AI training, the opportunities for carbon-aware scheduling will expand.

The key insight is that a carbon-optimal datacenter design will always involve trade-offs between renewable energy utilization and embodied carbon costs. Tools like Carbon Explorer help navigate this complex design space.

Alex: This has been really enlightening. To summarize what I've learned: achieving true 24/7 carbon-free computing is challenging but possible using a combination of renewable energy investments, energy storage, and carbon-aware scheduling. The optimal approach depends on geographic location and balancing operational versus embodied carbon.

Dr. Green: That's an excellent summary, Alex. And it's worth emphasizing that Carbon Explorer has been open-sourced at GitHub.com/facebookresearch/CarbonExplorer, so researchers and datacenter operators can use it to analyze their own scenarios and find carbon-optimal solutions.

As computing continues to grow, designing sustainable datacenters becomes increasingly important. The ultimate goal is to reduce the total carbon footprint of computing—both operational and embodied—and contribute to broader sustainability efforts. This research provides a framework to make those decisions in a systematic, data-driven way.

Alex: Thank you, Dr. Green, for explaining these complex concepts. It's encouraging to see rigorous scientific approaches being applied to datacenter sustainability challenges.

Dr. Green: You're welcome, Alex. It's a fascinating area where computer architecture, energy systems, and environmental considerations all intersect. I'm looking forward to seeing how these approaches evolve and scale in the coming years.
