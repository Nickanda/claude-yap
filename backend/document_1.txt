Professor Parker: Hello Alex, welcome to today's discussion on "The Effectiveness of Disruptive Climate Activism." We'll be exploring how certain activist tactics work—or don't work—in advancing climate action.

Alex: Thanks, Professor Parker. I've been seeing a lot of news about climate activists using pretty dramatic tactics lately. Could you start by explaining what "disruptive climate activism" actually means?

Professor Parker: Certainly! Disruptive climate activism refers to protest actions that deliberately interrupt normal activities or damage property to draw attention to climate issues. A recent example that made headlines was when activists from Just Stop Oil threw soup on a Van Gogh painting in a museum.

Alex: Wait—they threw soup on a Van Gogh? Why would they target art? That seems completely unrelated to climate change.

Professor Parker: That's exactly one of the key issues we'll discuss today. The activists were trying to generate attention for their cause, and they certainly succeeded in that regard. The painting was protected by glass, so no permanent damage was done. But your reaction highlights a critical problem: the connection between the action and climate change wasn't immediately clear to most observers.

Alex: So did it work? Or did it just make people angry at the activists?

Professor Parker: That's the central question. I would argue that disruptive climate activism can only productively drive climate action when placed in the appropriate context and backed with appropriate expertise. When the purpose of the disruption becomes confusing or unclear, it can actually harm the cause.

Alex: What do you mean by "appropriate" in this context?

Professor Parker: "Appropriate" is admittedly subjective, which is why activists need to exercise caution. Many experts recommend that scientists join civil disobedience efforts because they can lend credibility to the actions. As Capstick and colleagues note, "the trusted position of scientists in society affords a respected standpoint from which to demand change; for this reason alone, their participation is valuable as part of social movements."

Alex: That makes sense. People might take the protests more seriously if respected scientists are involved. But doesn't that create a dilemma? Like, either you protest mildly and nobody notices, or you do something extreme and get attention but people think you're just being destructive?

Professor Parker: You've identified exactly what scholars like Davis call the activist's paradox: "activists must choose between moderate actions that are largely ignored and more extreme actions that succeed in gaining attention, but may be counterproductive to their aims as they tend to make people think less of the protester."

Alex: So what's worse—being ignored and making no change, or getting negative attention that might hurt your cause?

Professor Parker: That's the million-dollar question! To answer it, we need to consider how we measure the effectiveness of activism. Successful activism generally increases the number of people who care about a cause and are willing to take action. If disruptive activism creates negative perceptions, it reduces the pool of potential supporters.

Alex: I guess that means you need to be very strategic about what you're disrupting and how you're doing it?

Professor Parker: Precisely. I'd argue that if people are confused about the purpose of the disruption, or if they just see it as activists being annoying or inconsiderate, that's extremely dangerous to climate activism. As Malm points out in an opinion piece, "sabotage is most effective when it is precise and gritty. When activists from the same group smashed gas stations in April this year, they hit the nail on the head. Gasoline, unlike a Van Gogh painting, is a fuel of global warming."

Alex: That makes so much more sense! Attacking a gas station has a clear connection to fossil fuels and climate change. It's like the difference between protesting at a power plant versus disrupting public transit, right?

Professor Parker: Exactly! Consider other successful protests: picketing the White House for women's rights, or guarding sacred trees during deforestation attempts. These actions leave no question about what the protest is for. The target and the cause are clearly connected.

Alex: But is it ever morally justified to destroy property for a cause, even if the connection is clear?

Professor Parker: That's a complex ethical question. Malm addresses this by saying, "you may destroy an inanimate object—and no one in the climate movement is suggesting anything other than targeting dead things—so as to protect living beings." But my focus today isn't primarily on the ethics—it's on effectiveness. It's about optics.

Alex: Optics?

Professor Parker: Yes, public perception. When the purpose of the activism becomes murky, activists end up spending excessive energy educating the public about what their demonstration symbolizes rather than focusing on the climate message itself. That's inefficient activism.

Alex: I see what you mean. I read something about the Van Gogh incident where someone tried to justify it by making some complex connection between Impressionist paintings and industrial modernity, but that seems like a stretch.

Professor Parker: You're referring to Meyer's satirical statement where he wrote: "and the impressionists, who stood in sunlit fields and on Parisian balconies and captured the feeling of industrial modernity breaking into the world like a yolk from a shell, are as linked to that vision as the automobile. No wonder climate activists, the rebels of this century, are targeting them." The point resonates because it's absurd—who would naturally make that connection? Very few people.

Alex: It's almost like bad marketing—if people don't understand your message, the campaign fails.

Professor Parker: That's an excellent analogy! Effective marketing communicates its message clearly and directly. Similarly, effective activism shouldn't leave people scratching their heads about what you're trying to achieve.

Alex: So what would more effective climate activism look like?

Professor Parker: First, it should maintain a clear connection between the action and climate change. Second, it might benefit from having scientific credibility behind it. Third, it should consider the impact on potential supporters, not just current opponents.

Alex: That makes me think about something else—aren't climate activists and those they're disrupting sometimes working toward similar goals? Like with the museum example—both want to preserve something valuable, right?

Professor Parker: Excellent observation. As Meyers notes, "climate activists and museum workers are on the same team... both trying to preserve a priceless intergenerational gift for the public." One is preserving cultural heritage, the other our natural heritage. While disruptive climate activism definitely has a place, it's important not to create unnecessary divisions or distractions from this shared mission.

Alex: So it's about being strategic and making sure your actions align with your message?

Professor Parker: Exactly. As I like to say, the path of climate action may not be straight, but let's not make it a winding mess. Disruptive activism can be powerful when it clearly communicates its purpose and builds bridges rather than barriers to understanding.

Alex: This has really helped me think more critically about activism strategies. I used to just see these news stories and either feel annoyed or confused, but now I understand there's a whole strategic dimension to consider.

Professor Parker: That's what thoughtful analysis is all about—moving beyond immediate emotional reactions to understand effectiveness. The climate crisis needs effective action, not just any action. Remember, it's not about whether disruption is good or bad in abstract terms, but whether specific disruptive tactics advance or hinder the ultimate goal of addressing climate change.

Alex: Thanks for this discussion, Professor. It's given me a lot to think about regarding how activism strategies need to be carefully considered for their actual impact.

Professor Parker: You're welcome, Alex. As we navigate the challenging terrain of climate action, we need to constantly evaluate our methods. Disruption can be powerful when applied thoughtfully, with clear connection to the cause, and with an eye toward building rather than alienating potential allies. After all, addressing climate change will require bringing more people into the movement, not pushing them away.
